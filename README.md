# Circle median filter toolbox (CMF)
 
This toolbox contains a fast algorithm for median filtering of signals and images with values 
    on the unit circle, for example phase or orientation data.
It is a reference implementation (in C++ with Matlab wrappers) of the algorithms described in the paper

### Example

*Left:* A circle-valued image, i.e. every pixel takes its value on the unit circle (or in angular representation a value in (-pi, pi]). The values are visualized as hue component in the HSV color space.
*Right:* Effect of the circle-median filter using a filter mask of size 7 Ã— 7. 


### Contents
- demos:     some demos, self explanatory (implemented in Matlab)
- auxiliary: some useful helper functions (implemented in Matlab)
- filters:   the fast algorithms for median filtering of circle valued data 
(implemented in C++ with Matlab wrappers)

### Installation and usage

- From Matlab: Run CMF_install.m in the Matlab console and follow the demos 
- From C++: Compile CMF_library.cpp. The relevant functions are medfiltCirc2D and medfiltCirc2DQuant. Their usage is described as comment in the CMF_library.cpp file.
